A documentary recording the project was released online last year.The Palace Museum, which is also known as the Forbidden City, was China's imperial palace between 1420 and 1911.\"The collaboration was not only a dialogue between the restorers but an exchange of techniques and expertise,\" Wang says. \"We worked together in a climate of utmost sincerity, overcame a number of challenges and accomplished our mission in full.\"Copyright 1995 -.

He was sold to a family in Guangdong province.He was one of 13 children abducted between 2006 and 2014 by Wang's gang. Most were sold in Guangdong.In 2014, Wang was captured by police, but the children couldn't be found because their faces had changed over the years.\"Their appearance had changed a lot, so we turned to the AI technology. By comparing the AI photo with those in the police database, we were able to narrow the search and locate the target more accurately,\" said Jiang Xiaoling, an officer at the Sichuan Public Security Bureau.Police then took samples of the children's blood and compared their DNA with possible parents. So far, police have found 10 of the 13 children Wang's gang had kidnapped. Of those, seven were found with the assistance of AI technology, Jiang said.Chen said the technology will be expanded to public security departments across the country after more experience is accumulated.According to Ministry of Public Security data, from May 2016 to May this year, 57 children were kidnapped. The number was down sharply from the 1990s, when there were hundreds of cases annually.According to Meng Qingtian, a senior official in the ministry's anti-trafficking office, the rapid decline can be attributed to the setting up of a quick-response mechanism.An alarm system called Tuanyuan, which means reunion in English, was launched in May 2016.Meng said the system, which was developed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, is able to rapidly push out information about missing children to enlist the public's help in finding them.The Tuanyuan system is connected with 25 new media platforms and mobile apps, including the Didi taxi service, Amap, Baidu, Taobao, and TencentQQ, allowing people to receive timely alerts about missing children around them.By May 15, the Tuanyuan system had shared information of 3,978 missing children, including 57 abducted ones. Of the total, 3,901, or 98 percent, were found quickly and returned.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

Christensen reached the courtroom at 8:40 am, wearing blue button down shirt and tan dress pants.Zhang Yingying's father, mother and her younger brother all appeared at the court before 9 am.The first trial day started with choosing potential jurors from first panel of 16 people.Sixteen potential jurors were called on Monday morning and asked if they knew any of the lawyers, court clerks or potential witnesses, to determine whether a potential juror can be fair.The lengthy witness list included about 88 potential witnesses from the prosecution, many of them FBI agents or biologists, and about 53 from the defense, including Christensen's ex-wife.US District Judge James Shadid questioned the 16 candidates for the jury. He read off lengthy witness list, which includes mostly law enforcement, but also members of Zhang Yingying family plus some University of Illinois employees and Christensen's ex-wife.Shadid also told panel the case involves evidence of kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder. The 16 jurors were asked whether they could judge the case fairly and were open to the death penalty.The jury selection process appeared to be moving slowly. The morning group of 16 was still being questioned as of 1:30 pm.Another group of 16 potential jurors were still questioned in the afternoon.Jury selection was expected to last about a week, but will now likely run longer as attorneys pare down the initial pool to a group of 70 jurors. From there, 12 jurors and six alternates will be selected to hear the trial.Zhang, 26, went missing on June 9, 2017, after getting into a black Saturn Astra about five blocks from where she got off a bus on her way to an apartment complex to sign a lease.Christensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, after being caught on tape pointing out people he described as \"ideal victims\" during a vigil in Zhang's honor. On July 5, then US Magistrate Judge Eric I. Long ordered that Christensen remain detained in the custody of the US Marshals Service pending trial.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

It came amid ongoing tension between the world's two largest economies.Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said China is willing to work together with the US to find solutions concerning differences on the economic and trade fronts, and to reach a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement.\"However, cooperation has to be based on principle and there are bottom lines in consultations,\" Wang said. \"China will not compromise on major issues of principle.\"The US government has persisted with certain demands in its negotiations with China, Wang said. For example, it insisted on including \"mandatory requirements\" concerning China's sovereign affairs in the agreement, which only served to delay the talks' progress, he said.The white paper said, \"red lines\" cannot be crossed in bilateral negotiations, the right to development cannot be sacrificed, and sovereignty cannot be undermined.China and the US have been engaged in a trade dispute for several months. The tension has been escalating since they reached a deadlock over economic and trade negotiations.The consultations, launched in early February 2018, have come a long way with the two sides \"agreeing on most parts of the deal,\" the paper said. \"But the consultations have not been free of setbacks, each of them being the result of a US breach of consensus and commitments as well as backtracking.\"The paper listed, in chronological order, three times when the US backtracked on a deal.The first time was when the US government announced an additional tariff of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese exports, despite the negotiators having reached preliminary consensus on expanding China's imports of agricultural and energy products from the US.The US government \"kept changing its demands\" in the previous more than 10 rounds of negotiations, the paper said.However, some US officials argued that China backtracked on nearly all aspects of the trade deal, according to earlier reports from foreign media.Wang said the US accusations of China reneging on the deal are groundless. When consultations are in progress, it is not uncommon for both sides to propose adjustments to the text of an agreement, Wang said. \"Nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon,\" he said.In response to the latest US tariff move, China raised additional tariffs to a maximum 25 percent on part of $60 billion worth of US products, effective June 1. China1has had to take forceful measures to defend the interests of the nation and its people, Wang said.He said details about the list of \"unreliable entities\"－foreign parties that harm the interests of Chinese companies－will be announced soon. The list aims to ensure a stable, fair and sustainable trade order between companies, and there's no need to over-interpret it, he said.Dong Yan, director of the international trade office at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said a country's sovereignty and dignity must be respected in bilateral consultations. It is necessary to ensure that any agreement can be balanced, which can satisfy the needs of both sides, Dong said.Jock O'Connell, international trade adviser for independent research and consulting company Beacon Economics, said too many of the US administration's demands go to the heart of Chinese economic policy and even touch on the issue of national sovereignty.Liu Yinmeng in Los Angeles contributed to this story.Copyright 1995 -.

As of May, Chinese companies accounted for more than 30 percent of all essential patents related to international standards for 5G.Meanwhile, a string of foreign companies, including Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel, have participated in three phases of technical tests organized by China to get their 5G products and solutions ready for commercial use in the country.\"As always, we welcome domestic and foreign enterprises to actively participate in China's 5G network construction and application promotion, and jointly share the opportunities,\" the ministry said.The move marks an accelerated push by China to apply 5G. Its previous plan was to commercialize the technology in 2020. The next-generation tech is expected to be at least 10 times faster than 4G and its huge capacity to connect things will enable smart factories, self-driving vehicles and other applications.Gong Daning, a senior engineer at the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a think tank, said China is in a pioneering position globally in the development of medium-frequency 5G telecom gear, smartphones and chips.\"More important, China is open to all players. Foreign companies such as Qualcomm and Intel are members of the nation's 5G working group, which was established in 2013, and they have played an important role in bringing China's 5G industrial chain to maturity,\" Gong said.The country's three telecom carriers are expected to spend 900 billion to 1.5 trillion yuan ($130 billion to $217 billion) on 5G network construction from 2020 to 2025, according to a report from the academy.Markus Borchert, president of Nokia China, said in a reply to China Daily on Monday, \"This is great news that the 5G commercial rollout will start soon in China, and the cooperation with multinational companies is highly recognized by the Chinese government, which makes us more confident in the healthy, steady and sustainable development of China's 5G industry.\" Borchert said Nokia China will leverage its technological advantages and years of experience in serving local customers to promote China's active engagement in the global 5G ecosystem.Swedish telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson said on Monday that it has maintained long-term friendships with China's telecom carriers and is ready to partner with local companies to promote 5G deployment.China is set to become the world's largest 5G market by 2025, with 460 million 5G users, according to a forecast by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association, an industry group.Copyright 1995 -.

For example, a similar pair of gravity clocks from the collections of the Palace Museum and Cartier are presented together for juxtaposition. The clocks, whose movements are driven by gravity that makes them roll down slowly on an inclined base, both have to be reset by hand.There are also abundant exhibits of \"mystery clocks\", the signature objects made by Cartier where clock hands appear to \"float\" on transparent dials without any apparent connection to the movement.

It is an important indicator of a society's level of civilization, he said.The key to promoting trash sorting is to step up scientific management, establish a long-term mechanism and nurture good habits, he said.Xi called for steady, concrete efforts to guide the public and for adjusting measures to fit local conditions as the country moves forward with trash sorting measures.He also underlined the need for extensive endeavors to educate the public on the subject, and through effective supervision and guidance to enable more people to develop responsible habits.The president has highlighted the importance of trash sorting on several occasions.In December 2016, he chaired a meeting of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economic Affairs in which measures promoting a trash sorting mechanism were studied.The establishment of a waste disposal system that separates trash into categories during collection, transport and processing procedures must be accelerated, he said at the time.A trash sorting system, developed on the basis of the rule of law, must be carried forward by authorities, ensure participation from all of society and coordinate the development of rural and urban areas, the president added.Starting this year, trash sorting has been promoted in all cities at the prefectural level or above. It was piloted in 46 cities earlier.A survey conducted by the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy under the Ministry of Ecology and Environment found that 92.2 percent of the public recognized the importance of trash sorting to the protection of the environment. More than 30 percent of respondents said they think they are doing very well, or relatively well, with sorting.More than 13,000 individuals across the country responded to the survey.Ren Yong, head of the ministry's Environmental Development Center, said a viable option to encourage trash sorting by the public is to offer incentives to residents to participate.He noted, for example, communities in Xiamen, Fujian province, that have a mobile phone app that rewards residents for separating waste at collection points.It is also important to ensure the separation of trash during transport, he said.\"It is a systematic project from the beginning to the end, and thus it will require a step-by-step effort,\" he said.Copyright 1995 -.

Germany and China, as well as Europe and China, should join hands to maintain world peace and stability, protect free trade and safeguard the existing international order.When meeting with Merkel, Wang called on China and Germany, as all-around strategic partners, to strengthen cooperation in building a fairer and more reasonable global governance system and to jointly face uncertainties.Facing the profound and complex changes in the international situation, China always insists on doing its own share, staying calm and clearheaded, showing composure, shouldering responsibility and reacting rationally, he said.Merkel said that facing the current complex and volatile international environment in which various new problems are emerging, Germany remains committed to safeguarding the principle of multilateralism and the existing international order.She said Germany advocates strengthening international coordination and collaboration through dialogue, and disagrees with the use of threats and pressure to solve problems.Tian Dewen, deputy director of the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that it is important that China and Germany, which are both firm supporters of economic globalization and multilateralism, reach a new consensus amid the complicated global situation.\"They both are major economies in the world, and their willingness to work together and safeguard multilateralism will definitely bring a positive impact to the world economy,\" he said.He Yun, an assistant professor at Hunan University's School of Public Management, said that Germany and China share many overlapping interests that demand closely-coordinated efforts.\"As there is an increase in protectionism and unilateralism in the world, Berlin and Beijing's joint efforts to protect multilateralism, sustain global economic development and maintain regional and global stability are key to the world,\" she said.In 2018, bilateral trade amounted to nearly 200 billion euros ($223 billion). Germany has been China's biggest trade partner in Europe for 43 consecutive years, while China has been Germany's biggest trade partner for three years, said Chinese Ambassador to Germany Wu Ken.Copyright 1995 -.

Yet the Trump administration is now aiming to stop China's development, which could prove to be disastrous for both the United States and the entire world,\" he wrote.Sachs continued, \"Trump is lashing out against China. (He) is willfully trying to crush successful companies like Huawei by changing the rules of international trade abruptly and unilaterally. China has been playing by Western rules for the past 40 years. Now, the United States is trying to pull the rug out from under China by launching a new Cold War.\"The Wall Street Journal warned, \"Prepare for some collateral economic damage as the two sides ratchet up their dueling tariffs\" and noted, \"This is a political trade risk the economy hasn't faced since the 1930s, and no one knows where it might end.\"The Journal's editorial writers argued that reaching an agreement would benefit both nations and shouldn't be hard to hammer out:\"The outlines of a good deal seem clear enough. China makes specific commitments to reform its policies and markets to let foreign companies compete fairly without regulatory predation or theft. In return, Mr. Trump ought to agree to lift the tariffs he's imposed. This would give Mr. Xi a victory he can point to as he tries to sell China's trade concessions (at home). Mr. Trump can say the tariffs served their purpose, and he's achieved something with China no other president has.\"The Washington Post criticized Trump for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of trade negotiations and said: \"This unforced error is doubly regrettable because Mr. Trump arguably had the upper hand going into his trade talks with China. The Chinese economy is more dependent on exports to the United States than vice-versa, and China's growth rate has been slowing while the US economy is creating jobs at a brisk pace.\"In a world where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular his complaints — shared by previous US presidents—against China represented a rare case in which other nations conceded him the moral high ground. A savvier president would take advantage of that.\"Earlier this month, the US repealed tariffs on steel and aluminum after reaching a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico.Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute of Global Affairs and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, wrote in Project Syndicate that the current trade dispute with China is similar to the 1980s trade dispute with Japan:\"'When governments permit counterfeiting or copying of American products, it is stealing our future, and it is no longer free trade.' So said US President Ronald Reagan, commenting on Japan in September 1985. Today resembles, in many respects, a remake of this 1980s movie, but with a reality-television star replacing a Hollywood film star in the presidential leading role — and with a new villain in place of Japan.\"The New York Federal Reserve Bank estimated that US tariffs on China will cost American households about $831 a year.At the Nomura Investment Forum Asia held recently in Singapore, Chief US Economist Lewis Alexander said the net effect of tariffs is likely to be negative for America, boosting inflation 0.5 percent in the next 12 months and slowing the economy.There has been some speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. But Alexander told CNBC such a move while inflation is ticking up could overheat the economy and lead to a painful downturn.In Forbes magazine, columnist Jack Nasher argued: \"Trump will be in serious trouble if tariffs on US products continue. The effect of the higher tariffs Trump announced would hit US economic growth by half a percentage point in 2020 and cost around 300,000 jobs. This could jeopardize Trump's 2020 reelection. Hence, tariffs are not a permanent option, but only a bargaining chip. (Investor) Warren Buffett is right when he says that a trade war would be bad, but 'There are times in negotiations when you talk tough. With some people in negotiations, the best technique is to act half crazy.'\"Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

In its lengthy white paper, Beijing blamed Washington for \"backtracking\" on three occasions. In its reply, Washington accused Beijing of moving \"away from previously agreed-upon provisions\" after agreement was reached \"on a number of important matters\".Putting who started it and who is pursuing it aside, the blame game is counterproductive, harmful, and potentially dangerous.Counterproductive because it serves neither party's purpose in maneuvering a win-win pattern of economic and trade ties. Harmful because the exchange of verbal swords does nothing except harden their attitudes to each other, as Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong observed. Potentially dangerous because it is already poisoning broader bilateral relations by spilling over into other areas, such as people-to-people exchanges.What has set the two sides apart is both believe the other is to blame for the talks breaking down. Beijing insists nothing is agreed upon until everything is. Washington sees nothing wrong in going ahead with punitive moves while negotiations proceed.Should the current dispute persist, rather than have their differences settled, the world's two largest economies will find it increasingly difficult to return to the negotiating table. In that case, there is no guarantee they can avoid embarking on a collision course.It is obvious from both parties' policy statements so far that both remain in favor of constructive engagement as well as a win-win outcome.But also that their expectations remain divergent: Beijing sees nothing inappropriate in the bilateral economic and trade ties and wants to preserve their \"stability\", a negotiated agreement to be \"equal\" and Washington to respect its \"sovereignty and dignity\". Washington deems the past decades of economic and trade exchanges exclusively favored Beijing, and now wants them, as the US president said, to be the other way round.Considering Beijing has demonstrated its readiness to address Washington's concerns, the latter should reciprocate in kind, focusing more on balance, rather than a pro-Washington imbalance in order to correct what it believes is a past wrong.Assigning liabilities for the present impasse entirely to the other is in no way constructive. It always takes two to tango.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

Heinz, the latter of which had been owned by Berkshire and Brazil's 3G Capital, which runs Kraft Heinz day-to-day.Buffett defended 3G's management, saying the combined company is doing well operationally, and that its current problems cannot be blamed on a lack of investment.But he also maintained that \"we paid too much money\" for Kraft.\"You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much,\" he said, while adding it was \"not inconceivable\" Berkshire could partner with 3G again on a transaction.He said 3G had more willingness to take on leverage and \"pay up,\" but in many cases also had \"way better operators.\"ReutersCopyright 1995 -.

They're not good for anyone,\" Regan said on the show. \"So I want to believe, Xin, I want to believe that something can get done.\"Regan, who addressed Liu on a first-name basis, contrasted what she said on her show two weeks ago, when she said that US tariffs were a \"necessary response\" to China \"stealing\" billions worth of intellectual property a year.Liu told Regan that China has made its position very clear that if the US treats the Chinese negotiating team with respect and shows the willingness to talk without using outside pressure, there is a high possibility that there could be a productive trade deal.\"Otherwise, I think we might be facing a prolonged period of problems for both sides,\" she said.Regan, at the close of their 15-minute talk, said again, \"No one wants trade wars. But we have to think long hard about the right next steps.\"Liu, however, did counter an assertion by Regan that China's government controls its entire economy.\"Everybody thinks that China's economy is state-owned, state-controlled, everything is state, state, state. Let me tell you that is not the true picture,\" Liu said. \"We are a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics … we are quite mixed, very dynamic and very open as well.\"Liu said that according to statistics, about 80 percent of Chinese employees were employed by private enterprises, and 80 percent of Chinese exports were done by private companies.Asked how the US businesses operate in China with the risk of their intellectual property rights being stolen, Liu said many American companies have been established in China and they're very profitable.\"The great majority of them, I believe, plan to continue to invest in China and explore the Chinese market as well,\" Liu said. \"Now, US President Donald Trump's tariff makes it a little bit more difficult — makes the future a little bit uncertain.\"Liu said that there is consensus among Chinese people that no country or individual \"can be stronger\" and \"develop itself\" without intellectual property protection, and that isolated cases do not mean that America is stealing or Chinese people are stealing.The Global Times called the face-off of the two anchorwomen \"friendly, meaningful talks. Both agreed: trade war is bad! (For Trish, that's a change of heart, since she had tried to justify the US trade war against China.)\", it said on its Twitter account.A Twitter user, Ryan Bryant @RayCaiYan, said in a reply to Regan's tweet, \"That was not even a DEBATE, more like a Q&A session. I thought Trish could leverage some of Liu's answers to discuss the issues further, but sadly she couldn't.\"FionaXu tweeted: The American hostess is talking about free market. Tell me how American market is \"free\" under Trump's government? You mean protectionism equals free market???\"Jon Taylor, a professor of political science of the University of St. Thomas in Houston, said that while they pretty much disagreed on everything, it offered US viewers the chance to actually hear the Chinese side of the issues.\"I think that Liu Xin did a very good job by demonstrating great confidence in both her questions and answers,\" Taylor said.The debate idea came about after the two newswomen clashed earlier this month after Regan said Beijing stole \"$600 billion worth of intellectual property a year\", leading to the Trump administration tariffs.The debate ended cordially with Liu inviting Regan to China.Copyright 1995 -.

The \"safe\" limits were most frequently exceeded in Asia and Africa, but sites in Europe, North America and South America also had levels of concern showing that antibiotic contamination was a \"global problem\", according to the team.Copyright 1995 -.

During his 34-year diplomatic career, he has spent two-thirds of the time dealing with issues related to Japan.He has served in Chinese diplomatic missions in Japan on three occasions, and was China's ambassador to Vietnam from 2011 to 2014.The first time he served as a diplomat in Japan was in the 1980s. Kong said in an earlier interview with Japanese media that he was impressed by the developed economy and harmonious society in Japan, as well as the diligent Japanese people.China and Japan are geographically and culturally close to each other, he said.Since he was appointed vice-foreign minister in 2017, Kong has been in charge of affairs related to Asia, boundary and maritime affairs, treaties and laws, and consular services in the ministry.The veteran diplomat will succeed Cheng Yonghua, who has been Chinese ambassador to Japan for nine years.Relations between China and Japan have returned back on track since Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Japan last May and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Beijing last October.In a group interview with Chinese media on Tuesday, Kong said that communication and cooperation between the two countries has intensified, and their interests are highly integrated.Kong said that the two countries should continue to promote exchanges at all levels, continuously enhancing friendship between the two peoples and managing differences in bilateral ties.This year is the China-Japan Youth Exchange Promotion Year, and according to Kong, China and Japan have identified a series of specific exchange programs, aimed at promoting exchanges among 30,000 young people in the two countries over the next five years.He said the two sides will probably initiate a high-level consultation mechanism for people-to-people exchange this year.Speaking of bilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, Kong said that he hopes positive remarks made by Japan on the initiative will translate into concrete policies and practical action.China is willing to continue promoting cooperation in various fields with Japan such as infrastructure, finance, logistics and information technology, he added.Copyright 1995 -.

Some days later, Jin, then 27, was named as the suspect and detained.In 1996, Jin was given the death penalty with a two-year reprieve for intentional homicide by the Jilin Intermediate People's Court.He appealed, and the provincial high court sent the case back to the lower court for retrial a year later. But the intermediate court upheld the judgment.The higher court returned the case to the lower court in 1998 after he appealed again. But the ruling remained the same.Two years later, the high court approved the ruling, even though Jin continuously appealed during those years.The case turned in 2014, when the high court considered a retrial due to the repeated appeals and media reports on a possible forced confession.On Oct 24, 2018, the court said in the rehearing that it was uncertain whether Jin had the time, tools and motives to do the killing, \"so the chain of evidence in the case was not complete enough to prove the conviction\".In recent years, several wrongful convictions have been overturned through China's determination to uncover judicial miscarriages. But the state compensation, especially for the mental anguish, is still far from what they expected.For example, Li Jinlian, wrongly jailed for 19 years, applied for 20 million yuan for mental damage, but the Jiangxi High People's Court gave him 900,000 yuan.\"If the mental compensation can be increased through the applications, including ours, it may further alleviate damages brought by the miscarriages to people such as my client,\" Qu added.Copyright 1995 -.

Covering 35 Chinese cities, the festival promises a cultural feast from April 26 to July 6.This time, actress Zhao Wei, music producer Gao Xiaosong, and contemporary artist Xu Bing have been invited as ambassadors of the year. After a news conference promoting the event, China Daily met with Zhao Wei to learn about her impressions of Chinese and French culture, as well as the importance of film in cross-cultural communication.\"Film is an artistic language transcending borders. A person may have never been to China, but watched Chinese films,\" Zhao said. \"And art helps to foster better understanding among people from different countries and races.\"Rising to national prominence in the 90s as Xiao Yanzi (Little Swallow) in hit TV series, Zhao has starred in many box-office hits. Her directorial debutwas well received both by critics and audiences, becoming one of the highest grossing Chinese films of the year.Now the actress-director is working online. She took the job as executive producer for online TV drama, which will be broadcast on iQiyi, one of China's largest online streaming platforms.\"Some parts of this production are filmed abroad,\" she said. \"I chose the shooting location in France, because like China, France boasts a very rich culture and history with beautiful landscapes. If a story is imbued with such beautiful scenery and charming culture, it can please the eye and the mind.\"Having been actively involved in philanthropic work, Zhao launched the V Love Foundation for childhood leukemia in 2014. \"To set up a charity for leukemia, we have no idea how long we can keep it running. Every patient will cost 100,000 to 300,000 yuan,\" she said.\"This year is the fifth year of V Love. At first we could only support one child a month.

The number of bookings of red-eye and budget flights is nearly three times higher than other regular flights, the Qunar study said.Companies are also introducing low-price options to attract the young consumer group. In late May, Qunar teamed up with 33 domestic and foreign carriers, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, United Airlines and All Nippon Airways, to launch discounted prices for students on more than 3,000 routes, along with the concept of student flight tickets.Students who have registered successfully with their identification documents on the platform will be able to book cheaper tickets. For instance, a one-way flight ticket from Guangzhou to Beijing can be as cheap as 460 yuan ($66.7), which is about half of the price tag - 862 yuan - for a second-class seat on a high-speed train. Qunar said such low-price flight tickets compared with high-speed trains may change the travel habits of college students and create user stickiness.\"Low travel costs may stimulate college students to travel more frequently, and enable them to have higher budgets for spending on accommodation and destination entertainments,\" said Sun Peiming, director of e-commerce at Sichuan Airlines.Last year, along with graduate students, there were 37 million enrolled college students in the country, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In 2018, students registered on Qunar flew 4.4 times annually on average, higher than the average of 3.45 times nationwide, according to the company.\"Low prices have a decisive impact on their choices. Companies that provide cheaper options will attract more students and gain the initiative in seizing those future backbone consumers,\" said Liu Simin, a researcher at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.Candice Chen, a graduate studying in Beijing, traveled with a few of her friends to Japan in January. Despite living in Beijing, she bought return flight tickets that departed from the nearby city Tianjin to Japan, and the return tickets cost less than 1,500 yuan in total.\"It's a great deal as I can save more money for shopping in Japan. It's convenient to take a high-speed train from Beijing to Tianjin, which only took half an hour, and then I caught a taxi to go to Tianjin airport,\" she said.Last year, the per capita spending of college students on flights edged up 2.6 percent year-on-year, the study said without disclosing specific numbers, and indicated their high sensitivity on flight ticket prices. Despite that they try to save more money in buying flight tickets, college students prefer to stay at better hotels.Last year, the per capita spending of college students on hotels reached 234 yuan per night, jumping 17.5 percent over the previous year, and the growth rate was higher than the older generation. Besides, the report found that students are likely to spend twice the amount of money on hotels two years after graduation.Qunar has cooperated with more than 6,000 hotels, hostels and bed-and-breakfast services and launched discounted hotel prices for students.Copyright 1995 -.

Subsequently, China's market share is estimated to drop to 26 percent by 2040 or 14.6 million EVs. However, it will still be the largest market in the world.Data from United States-based industry research website EV Sales showed that in the first quarter of this year, global EV sales surpassed 500,000 units, up 58 percent year-on-year, and China accounted for almost half of the sales.\"Led by China, the cumulative growth in global EV sales has been astonishing. We estimate that global sales will jump from 2 million in 2018 to 28 million in 2030, and 56 million in 2040. Meanwhile, sales of traditional energy cars will decline from 85 million in 2018 to 42 million in 2040. In the next five to seven years, China's policy support for new energy vehicles will drive global growth,\" said Kou Nannan, head of research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.As early as in 2012, the State Council introduced a pipeline to guide the development of the nation's EVs, with a goal of producing 2 million units and selling 5 million EVs by 2020. Later on, central and local governments carried out a series of subsidy policies in the NEV industry, such as purchase tax exemption and purchase subsidies, to offer greater support to the industrialization of China's NEV industry.According to the agency, China will specifically lead in the e-bus market. It is estimated that by 2025, China's e-bus fleet share will reach 50 percent, and by 2040, the ratio will rise to roughly 80 percent.Over the years, e-buses have been accounting for an increasing ratio of city buses. In 2017, China's overall e-bus retention rate reached 35.9 percent, and every three buses included an e-bus, according to a report released by the consulting company under the China Center for Information Industry Development.Wu Chuxiao, senior analyst at the Automobile Industry Research Center under CCID Consulting, said: \"Currently, China's NEV industry has the condition and foundation for large-scale promotion and application in terms of politics, economy, society and technology. However, limited by techniques, cost, infrastructure and public awareness, it still takes a certain amount of time to replace traditional vehicles with NEVs on a large scale.\"\"Nevertheless, e-buses, as an essential part of the urban transportation network, have fixed operation routes and distance, exclusive parking lots with charging facilities, as well as public financial subsidies. Chances are that China will take a lead in the further development of electric buses,\" said Wu.Last month, the central government issued a guideline on promoting the application of e-buses, by supporting technology innovation, improving fiscal and taxation policies, enhancing infrastructure construction, as well as reinforcing fund supervision.\"It is estimated that in the future, China's e-bus market will transform to a more market-driven pattern, instead of policy-driven. The market will shift from an incremental market to a stock market, maintaining steady growth,\" he said.Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that EVs will attain price parity by the mid 2020s, as lithium battery prices have been falling. From 2010 to 2018, lithium battery prices dropped by over 85 percent, with an annual average decline rate of 20 percent. And the decline, with the same rate, is estimated to continue for the next few years.\"The fall in lithium battery prices is the primary impetus for the development of the EV industry. The economical advantage of EVs will continue to promote the development of the industry after 2025,\" Kou from Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

What are the common misunderstandings people have about actors and actresses? Joseph Graves, a veteran actor and director from the US, will tell you about the fun and reality of this glamorous trade.A teacher at Peking University and an actor on the stage, Graves has been living in China since 2002, dedicating his life to introducing Shakespearean plays to China. As the artistic director of PKU's Institute of World Theater and Film, he wants to help more Chinese university students experience the magic of performance.Graves points out that theater performances, where actors bring the audience together on a theatrical journey, are much more interactive than films. \"In the best circumstances, there is a kind of almost spiritual experience that happens between the audience and actors that can never happen in a film.\"He also demystifies the acting profession. \"Most people know actors most from movie stars or television stars. It leads people to think that all 'successful' actors are wealthy and beautiful,\" Graves said. But the overall picture is much more polarized. \"The reality is that 90 percent of actors die in poverty.\"With only a small group of actors making big money, one should be much more clearheaded when it comes to career choices. \"So to dedicate your life to film or television or the theater is a kind of risky life, in terms of financial security.\"Over the years, he has helped to establish performing arts departments in universities across China. \"I have interacted with thousands of students in a lot of different universities,\" he said. \"A lot of students have gone on to become drama teachers, actors, directors, writers here in China, some in America.\"But many problems are still unresolved. \"The slower part is finding a way to encourage the universities and the boards of education to develop these programs in a well-funded and well-staffed style.\"Graves plays a lot of characters with very strong personalities, such as the Greek hero Achilles and the idealistic knight Don Quixote. \"I do identify with someone being willing to spend their life trying to understand it, to understand themselves and other people, and to have the courage to say there are probably some things that are really true.\"He has been involved in six productions that integrated Chinese opera forms, including the Pulitzer-winning playwritten by Thornton Wilder. Shown at Beijing People's Art Theater with an international cast, it boldly combines Peking Opera with English monologues.\"I'm very familiar with several Chinese opera forms,\" he said. \"They are really quite beautiful and quite powerful once you begin to even have a smattering of understanding of what's going on.\"Copyright 1995 -.

But by working together they would also be able to promote a regional consensus on upholding the rules-based order. As the mainstays of the regional economy, by joining hands they could not only give it a shot in the arm but also provide impetus for a regional trade agreement.It is to be hoped therefore that reports prove correct that the countries intend to resume mutual naval visits, a practice that stalled in 2011. The resumption of such visits would be highly symbolic in this regard.They would also be of practical significance as a meaningful way for the two neighbors to reduce their strategic mistrust, which has festered and led both countries to boost their surveillance and patrol measures in the waters adjacent to the Diaoyu Islands.Needless to say, it is unrealistic to expect the two sides to completely resolve their differences during Abe's visit. But as long as they embrace the spirit of the treaty of peace and friendship enacted 40 years ago, they can build on the current trend of rapprochement and seek ways to accumulate more mutual trust, thus paving the way for better and more rewarding ties.Copyright 1995 -.

Although China's number is relatively low, it is comparatively one of the most significant parts of the investment portfolios of high net worth individuals.Paula Polito, client strategy officer at UBS global wealth management, said they are seeing high levels of cash globally. But she also stressed that, although it increases liquidity, cash may not necessarily be a safe strategy in the long run.Faced with many uncertainties, including downward pressure on China's economy and escalating trade friction between China and the United States, 36 percent of the 465 Chinese high net worth individuals - those with average personal wealth of at least 10 million yuan ($1.45 million) - polled by the Hurun Research Institute said that the focus of their investment strategy will be to \"avoid risks\" this year, mainly by increasing asset allocation to fixed income products, gold, bank deposits and currency products in the next three years.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management, said that investors sometimes focus too much on their home region. \"Diversification is still the best way to access opportunities and sidestep domestic risks,\" he said.Fortunately, a growing number of Chinese high net worth investors have started to realize the importance of not putting all their eggs in one basket, said Zi Yuan, head of investment platforms and solutions at UBS Securities. One solution is to hold different currencies to avoid the possible risk of the exchange rate fluctuation of one single currency.\"They are looking at more overseas markets. Different markets sometimes are little connected. For example, the Chinese stock market was really disheartening last year. But if an investor allocated his assets in the US stock market or other markets with high yield bonds, the loss in the Chinese stock market will be offset and the stability of the entire investment portfolio will be further consolidated,\" he said.Copyright 1995 -.

The Chinese also expressed more optimism about future ties.The percentage of people in China who said relations will take a turn for the better increased from 28.8 percent in 2017 to 38.2 percent this year.Those who did not regard the ties' prospects favorably accounted for 18.2 percent of respondents, a 10 percent drop from last year.Chinese respondents numbered 1,548 and were from Beijing, Shanghai and eight other cities, while 1,000 Japanese took part in the survey.The survey, co-conducted by China International Publishing Group and Japanese nonprofit Genron, showed that only 15.6 percent of people in Japan took an optimistic view about how their nation's ties with China are progressing.The Chinese public's impression of Japan largely improved this year. The poll showed that 42.2 percent of the Chinese respondents had a \"favorable\" impression of Japan, an increase of 11 percentage points from last year.And those who viewed Japan unfavorably also dropped by 11 percentage points to 46.1 percent this year.But 86.3 percent of respondents in Japan had an \"unfavorable\" impression of China, compared with 13.1 percent who viewed China favorably.Gao Anming, vice-president of China International Publishing Group, said Chinese respondents' views of bilateral ties and perspectives on Japan echo the momentum of improved bilateral relations, but added that sensitive issues between the two countries are still serious.Seventy-four percent of the Chinese questioned considered Sino-Japanese relations to be \"important\", and 70 percent supported China's cooperation with Japan on Asian affairs. But 79.4 percent of the Chinese took Japan as a military threat, a rise of 11.8 percentage points from 2017.Premier Li Keqiang visited Japan in May, and President Xi Jinping met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Vladivostok, Russia, in September.Jin Ying, a researcher at the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China and Japan should work together to keep the ties on a normal track.Copyright 1995 -.

The per capita spending on a study tour stood at 21,000 yuan ($3,040), according to Ctrip.Last year, 860,000 of Chinese students joined overseas study tours, and the number is expected to exceed 1 million in 2018. By 2020, the market scale of overseas study tours is expected to reach 40 billion yuan, according to the figures of the Ministry of Education and Chinabaogao.com.The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore were the top destinations for teenagers keen on overseas study tours and most of them were keen to take language classes, to improve their English, as part of these programs.\"A 'golden level', the highest-quality winter camp available on our website, requires the camp to provide more than five hours of classes every day. In addition, every 12 children need to be accompanied by a professional employee,\" said Zhang Jie, director of overseas study tours at Ctrip.\"Most of the Western countries take their winter breaks during the Christmas period, while the winter vacation of Chinese schools usually starts in late January, in line with the Spring Festival. When Chinese children take the tours, most of the foreign schools would have already started their new semesters. As a result, many of these products allow Chinese students to join real classes abroad,\" she said.Several countries are offering unique and specific programs to welcome Chinese children who come on study tours.

How did Mei Lanfang influence the European theater? Today we learn about these topics and more in a conversation with Stathis Livathinos, artistic director of the National Theater of Greece, a man who always stands at the forefront of the global stage.In February, his bilingual playwill open to audiences in Beijing. The work, an extraordinary experiment from the national theaters of China and Greece, will represent the merging of two great theatrical traditions.Livathinos, who has visited China three times, describes each of his journeys to the country with great affection. \"My first travel to China was 12 years ago I think, on my way to Xi'an, to see the Terracotta Army and Beijing, which was like a fairy tale for me, very unique,\" he said. \"Then I went to Tibet, which was a journey I will never forget in my life.\"Last year, the first collaborative project between the two national theaters –, by Chinese director Wang Xiaoying – became a big success in Athens. \"I was thrilled by. It was a great work, a very interesting epic play and a very difficult one,\" said Livathinos.Following, the Greek director agreed to bring a Greek play to China. The upcoming production, by ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus, often described as the father of tragedy, is the first part of his only extant trilogy. Livathinos chose this particular work to present something both Greek and international.\"is a part of something bigger that doesn't belong only to Greece.is a part, I think, of the world civilization. It's the same as Bach, like Shakespeare, like Pinter, like Beckett, like Da Vinci. These are the reasons we exist. These are the reasons that keep us human.\"Using a mostly Chinese cast, to tell a millennia-old tale from the European continent in front of a Chinese audience is more than just daring. And Livathinos is determined to create a distinctive play.\"Because it's part of an experiment we agreed on two years ago with the director of the National Theater of China. It will be a kind of theatrical and artistic meeting of civilizations onstage. Of course, this will be a very big risk. But it's better to go with a risk than with safety.\"Thanks to his theatrical education in Moscow, Livathinos is very familiar with the influence Chinese performing artists have had on theater in the West. \"Chinese theater and many actors, especially Mei Lanfang, at the beginning of the (20th) century, influenced the European theater very much, especially Meyerhold. And his relation to Meyerhold gave many important results in the world of the Russian classics and through them, as a big river, to the theater of the whole of Europe.\"Though he points out the language barrier during cultural exchanges, particularly in theatrical arts, what always matters most is the efforts people make. \"As a Chinese proverb goes, 'a big journey starts from one step'. It will take generations for real understanding to happen. But this is a good step and for me a very unique experience.\"Contact the producer at liwenrui@chinadaily.com.cnCopyright 1995 -.

The pieces were stored in the museum's warehouses, and about a third had not been exhibited to the public for several years.\"All these great masters are back on view here in the Uffizi in new spacious halls where we can have many visitors to admire them,\" says Uffizi's director, Eike Schmidt.\"It is as if a second, new museum had opened inside the gallery,\" he adds.Titian's Venus of Urbino hangs in a room with two other paintings and is among the most celebrated canvas on display in the new section of the Florence art gallery.The colors of the renovated rooms were chosen to represent the works they host: green, inspired by the drapery and wall hangings seen in numerous Venetian Renaissance paintings, and dark grey for the Florence school, echoing the stones used to build the famed gallery itself.Federico Barocci's huge Virgin of the People (also known as Madonna del Popolo) has been placed in the Hall of Pillar, whose light-painted walls recall the atmosphere of a church. The room hosts a collection of altar pieces of the counter-reformation period.The total cost of the renovation was around 700,000 euros ($780,000). The amount includes $100,000 for the Venus of Urbino room donated by the nonprofit association Friends of the Uffizi Galleries.An individual member of the association, named Trish Savides, contributed $15,000 to the renovation of Lorenzo Lotto's Holy Family.ASSOCIATED PRESSCopyright 1995 -.

An eponymous ode to the character appears on Bowie's album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, which was released that year.With the album, Bowie redefined glam rock and spent 18 months in the years 1972 and 1973 touring the United Kingdom, North America and Japan.During the tour, Bowie invited a Cambridge University graduate, Mick Rock, to be his personal photographer. They first met backstage in March 1972.Now, 65 large framed photos by Rock, which capture Bowie in his dressing room, his transformation into Ziggy Stardust, shots of his live performances and candid, private moments between the shows, are being displayed as an exhibition, entitled Bowie by Mick Rock, at 798 Space in Beijing's 798 Art Zone from May 29 to Aug 4.The exhibition, which is supported by Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP, a nonprofit museum dedicated to reflecting contemporary popular culture, and co-organized by Beijing-based indie record label, Modern Sky, also showcases performance footage of Bowie, interviews with Rock, who talks about directing Bowie's first four music videos, as well as photos of other music legends of the era taken by Rock, including Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Debbie Harry. It's MoPOP's first exhibition to be staged in Asia.\"Mick Rock's great eye, his unlimited access to Bowie and the trust they shared allowed him to capture, in hundreds of photographs and four music videos, the artist's transformation into Ziggy Stardust and the '70s most intriguing and otherworldly rock star,\" writes Jasen Emmons, director of curatorial affairs at MoPOP, of the exhibition.The exhibition opens with a quote from Bowie: \"Mick sees me the way I see myself.\"It was what Bowie said to his manager when he reviewed the photos that Rock had taken for him.Under one photo, shot in a dressing room in Scotland in 1973, a line explains Bowie's creation of Ziggy Stardust, which was heavily influenced by two classical forms of Japanese theater: Kabuki and Noh. After a six-city tour in Japan in 1973, Bowie began using a special Noh theater makeup palette, which he applied himself.Between photos, quotes from Bowie are displayed, like \"I wish myself to be a prop, if anything, for my songs. I want to be the vehicle for my songs. I would like to color the material with as much visual expression as is necessary for that song\".Rock, who was born in London in 1948, continued to create iconic images of many other great artists, including Pink Floyd co-founder, Syd Barrett, and Queen lead vocalist, Freddie Mercury.\"I got pictures of David eating, drinking coffee, having a cigarette before going onstage, making himself up. I even got shots of him asleep,\" says Rock. \"I regarded myself as a guardian of his image, and that's true to this day.\"During the 1970s, Bowie released 11 albums, including five which are considered as classics. The legendary artist died on Jan 10, 2016, two days after he released his 25th studio album, entitled Blackstar.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

The initiative was first announced during Li's official visit to New Zealand in March 2017.\"More people-to-people contact between China and New Zealand will increase our mutual knowledge and awareness, which are central to more popular support for our bilateral relations and cooperation,\" Li's message said.Last year, there were around 600,000 visits between the two countries, and China remains New Zealand's second-largest overseas tourist market.In a message, read out by Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the recent Christchurch terrorist attacks brought into sharp relief the importance of building interactions and understanding across peoples, cultures and borders.\"Initiatives during the Year of Tourism reflect China and New Zealand's shared commitment to doing just that,\" she said.The year of tourism is sponsored by the Chinese and New Zealand governments and involves a range of events and initiatives in the two countries.Lisa Li, general manager of China Travel Service in New Zealand, said: \"More and more Chinese are visiting New Zealand each year. They come here for its beauty, fresh air and easygoing lifestyle.\"She said one of the big attractions, however, was Hobbiton, the film set used in The Lord of the Rings, in Waikato.\"I expect 2019 will be a great year, not only for New Zealand but for China,\" she said.Although Australia is still the No 1 source of tourists to New Zealand, current estimates indicate that China could overtake Australia by 2024.For New Zealanders, China is now the fifth most popular foreign destination. Already, six Chinese airlines operate direct flights between China and New Zealand.Stephen Jacobi, executive director of the New Zealand China Council, said the vast majority of New Zealanders want to see tourism links with China increase.\"China is currently our second-biggest source of inbound tourists, and this is projected to grow to around 800,000 visitors by 2024 ... outnumbering our (Australian) cousins across the Tasman,\" he said.\"In addition, according to our Perceptions of China Survey conducted last year, almost half of all New Zealanders say they would like to visit China in the future. So the China-NZ Year of Tourism is a fantastic opportunity to encourage visitors from both countries to explore each other's cultures,\" he said.Earlier in the year, there was speculation that the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism would not go ahead due to perceived problems in the relationship.\"The problems proved to be unfounded. New Zealand and China may not agree on everything all of the time, but both are agreed that enhanced tourist flows help both countries,\" Jacobi said.He highlighted that tourism is a driver of economic growth and cultural understanding. \"The Year of Tourism offers opportunities to foster new relationships and strengthen current ones.\"Kate Deng, who runs KateTravel, said at a conference on Chinese tourism in Wellington in December that many Chinese visitors to New Zealand were \"free, independent travelers\".\"They like to hire cars and tour, they like adventure holidays, … in other words, experiences they can share with friends and family back home via social media.\"Song Rui, director of the Tourism Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said at the conference that the main travelers are \"millennials, born between the 1980s and 1990s, who perceive travel as a way to enjoy life, not purchase products\".\"They love to share with friends and are a female-dominated group－62 percent,\" she said.Copyright 1995 -.

The dialogue restarted with the fourth round last April in Tokyo.Relations got back on the right track last year. President Xi Jinping had several meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at international gatherings, and Abe paid an official visit to China in October.The two governments decided that 2019 would be a year of China-Japan youth exchanges. The opening ceremony for this event was held in Beijing on Sunday.To promote the people-to-people relations, the two countries also plan to arrange mutual visits for 30,000 youths from each other in the next five years.Copyright 1995 -.

I was a really big fan.\"Set against lushly illustrated environments and a hand-drawn art style, Unruly Heroes updates theclassic tale into an epic adventure that is more colorful, humorous and lighthearted. As Lu introduced, the game differed a lot compared with the original story. \"For example, we reimagined White Bone Spirit as the owner of a beauty parlor, so gamers need to destroy her mask to defeat her.\"The game also subverts the stereotype about the underworld – the dark, spooky underworld is transformed into a fantastic amusement park.\"We add several 'baby' characters as bosses of the Underworld. The Underworld becomes a happy place controlled by babies,\" Lu said.Lu believes that Chinese culture has strong potential to reach a broader audience, but it needs the efforts of more companies and creative minds.\"We can integrate Chinese cultural elements into products that are accessible to people around the world. Video games, film and TV series, and other cultural and entertainment products resonate easily internationally,\" he said.\"I am not a scholar; I simply want to do what I can to present a story I love to more people far and wide,\" Lu added.Executive producer: Feng MinghuiReporter: Li WenruiGuest: Lu YangVoiceover: Li WenruiSubtitles: Ai PingAcknowledgement: Perfect World; Magic Design StudiosCopyright 1995 -.

It is encouraging then that the latest report on Japan's foreign policy and activities released on Tuesday notes that ties took a turn for the better last year. This was thanks to the efforts of both sides, as evidenced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official visit to Beijing in October, the first by a Japanese leader in nearly seven years.It is the vast common interests that they share that have prompted China and Japan to shelve their differences and seek a closer partnership. After all, China is Japan's largest trading partner, and Japan, China's third-largest. And both countries support free trade and the rules-based international trading system, which is threatened by the protectionism and unilateralism of the United States.Years of experience prove that cooperation between China and Japan, rather than competition, let alone confrontation, serves the best interests of both. That is why they have now agreed to strengthen economic cooperation in projects in third-party countries, and Japan has sent a \"high-level delegation\" to the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation that opens in Beijing on Thursday.Yet strengthening their economic relationship is just one aspect of their efforts to build mutual trust. Amity between the two peoples also holds the key to sound bilateral relations. Therefore, China and Japan have agreed to arrange exchange of visits for 30,000 young people of both countries in the coming five years.As for the territorial dispute, dialogue and exchanges through the maritime and air communication mechanism between the two countries' defense authorities, and security dialogue are the best way to build mutual trust and avoid any miscalculation that could lead to unexpected confrontations. A lot of progress has been made in that regard with both sides pledging to play their due part in safeguarding regional peace and stability.It is widely expected that President Xi Jinping will be making his first official visit to Japan in June to attend the Osaka G20 summit. Hopefully, that will further propel the good momentum in Sino-Japanese relations.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

The main asset of Unigroup Liansheng is Linxens, a French smart chip components maker that Unigroup acquired last year.The move is the first time Unigroup has disclosed the price of the Linxens deal, making it the biggest-ever overseas acquisition the Beijing-based company has made since it entered the semiconductor sector six years ago.Linxens, which was founded in 1979, provides flexible connectors used in smart cards. Its clients are from sectors including telecom, hotel, finance, e-governance, and the internet of things, with a presence in France, Germany, Singapore, Thailand, China and other countries and regions.Shares of Unigroup Guoxin surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 49.62 yuan ($7.18) after they resumed trading on Monday.Shen Meng, director of boutique investment bank Chanson and Co, said Tsinghua Unigroup is making a push into semiconductors, with an aim to manufacture all types of chips.By acquiring Linxens, Unigroup Guoxin can better integrate industrial chain resources, beef up its role in its existing smart security chip business and offer better products to government agencies and State-owned enterprises, Shen said.The announcement came as Chinese companies step up their push to grow the homegrown chip industry. It is also the latest push by Unigroup to expand its business in the sector.The parent group acquired Spreadtrum Communications Inc, the world's third-largest mobile phone chipmaker back then, in 2013. Later, it also bought RDA Microelectronics Inc, the fourth-largest. Unigroup is also building a large memory chip plant in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, to reduce the country's reliance on foreign memory processors.China is the world's largest semiconductor market. It spends more on importing chips than it does on crude oil imports. In 2018, its chip imports exceeded $312 billion, up from $260 billion in 2017, data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology show.In May, the State Council offered fresh confidence and impetus to the country's integrated circuit and software sectors with its decision to continue preferential corporate tax policies.Chip designers and software producers will be exempt from corporate taxes for two years. For the following three years, their corporate taxes will be halved.Xiang Ligang, director-general of Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association, said globally competitive homegrown processors are a must for Chinese tech companies to ensure strategic security.Copyright 1995 -.

Candidates have unveiled their Brexit stances. Some favor an immediate hard Brexit, others favor reopening negotiations with the EU and a possible deferral of the scheduled Oct 31 departure date, and others are ranged in between.Candidates have also unveiled other policy plans.Johnson said in his column in the Daily Telegraph that he would like to increase per-student funding sent to secondary schools to a minimum of 5,000 pounds ($6,300) a year.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wants to establish an Irish Border Council to work with communities to avoid post-Brexi tdisruption along the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.Home Secretary SajidJavid wants to spend 100 billion pounds on improving the UK's infrastructure.And Sam Gyimah, the former universities minister, wants a second referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.Conservative Party grandees, meanwhile, have appealed to the party's 1922 Committee, which manages rules and discipline, and asked it to look at the rules surrounding leadership elections. Currently, MPs only need two other MPs to back them in order to stand in a leadership race. The 1922 Committee will look at whether prospective candidates should jump through more hoops in order to stand, something that would likely lead to smaller fields.The committee is expected to make a decision on Tuesday.The 13 hopefulsJames CleverlyMichael GoveSam GyimahMatt HancockMark HarperJeremy HuntSajidJavidBoris JohnsonAndrea LeadsomKit MalthouseEsther McVeyDominic RaabRory StewartCopyright 1995 -.

These foreign companies have already particiapted in three phases of tests organized by China to get their 5G products and solutions ready for commercial use in the country.\"With joint efforts of all parties, China has built a foundation for commercialization of 5G,\" the ministry said, adding it will issue commercial 5G licenses in the near future, a clear sign China will soon officially enter the first year of 5G.\"As always, we welcome domestic and foreign enterprises to actively participate in China's 5G network construction and effort to promote application of the technology, and jointly share 5G development opportunities,\" the ministry added.China's big three telecom carriers are forecast to spend 900 billion to 1.5 trillion yuan ($134 billion to $223 billion) in total on 5G network construction from 2020 to 2025, according to a report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. In comparison, Chinese telecom operators spent 720 billion yuan on 4G network construction from 2014 to 2018.Specifically in 2019, expenditure on 5G-related infrastructure by the country's big three telecom operators — China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom — is expected to reach 34.2 billion yuan. China Mobile plans to build 30,000 to 50,000 5G base stations this year, while China Telecom is looking to have 20,000.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

Only one in every 2,500 applications for a license plate is successful.In Shanghai, a limited supply of license plates are auctioned to the highest bidder, with the average price being 90,000 yuan ($13,041).Industry insiders have long said that vehicle restriction policies ease urban traffic pressure to a certain extent, but they have two negative effects that cannot be ignored.Copyright 1995 -.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute students testing the technology move inside the 12-foot-high, wrap-around projection to order virtual bean curd from the panda waiter, chat with Beijing market sellers and practice tai chi by mirroring moves of a watchful mentor.\"Definitely less anxiety than messing it up with a real human being,\" says Rahul Divekar, a computer science graduate student working on the project. \"So compared to that anxiety, this is a lot more easy.\"The \"Mandarin Project\" is a joint venture of RPI and IBM. Cognitive and Immersive Systems Laboratory researchers are developing a sort of smart room that can understand students' words, answer their questions and perceive their gestures. Lessons are presented as games or tasks, like ordering a meal out.Divekar orders Peking duck \"Beijing kaoya\" and the panda fetches the virtual dish. Divekar says the food was good \"Cai hen hao chi\" but he can't pay the bill. No problem, the panda replies \"ni keyi xi pan zi\" you can wash the dishes.Other scenes include an outdoor market and a garden, each a high-tech twist on cultural immersion.\"Our plan is to complete several scenes of real life in China, to let the student be able to have a virtual trip over there,\" says Hui Su, director of the lab at RPI.Tests on the room with students studying Mandarin will continue this school year as they work on additional scenes, including an airport. A six-week course is being readied for the summer.Artificial intelligence, or AI, is ubiquitous in everything from call-center chat-bots to home assistants. Even some language instruction products on the market feature AI or virtual reality.The Mandarin Project is notable for its scale and sophistication. Computers simultaneously interpret speech and gesture to keep a dialogue going. When a student points to a picture and asks \"What's that?\" computers can come up with an answer.And feedback is immediate. When Divekar orders dou fu or tofu a voice responds \"here's how close you got\" and illustrates it with a graph of his intonation. Another voice gives the precise pronunciation.Still, language teachers need not fear for their jobs just yet. Developers of the Mandarin Project say it isn't sophisticated enough right now to completely replace classroom instruction.RPI president Shirley Ann Jackson foresees the same type of technology being applied to other spaces, such as corporate boardrooms. When the executives discuss a potential acquisition, the room will follow the group discussion and produce relevant information seamlessly into the debate.\"We're not at the end of the line,\" Jackson says, \"but closer to the beginning.\"Xinhua - APCopyright 1995 -.

There were no issues of discipline ongoing.\"Hansen said police were looking for the resignation notice.Firing indiscriminately across three floors of the municipal building, the gunman killed seven men and five women, all but one of whom worked for the government of the coastal city a four-hour drive southeast of Washington.Craddock was armed with two.45 caliber pistols purchased legally, authorities said, and reloaded several times during the shooting, before police shot him dead during a gunfight.US gun ownership laws are among the most lax in developed countries, and legislative efforts to address the issue have long been deadlocked.Agence France - presseCopyright 1995 -.

Among its other products are machine elements, drive systems and clamping devices.\"When tariffs rise, products become more expensive and usually less are bought,\" said Stefan Haenchen, general manager of the company, in the wake of the latest flare-up of US-China trade tensions.Earlier last month, Washington increased additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent, and has threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports.In response, China announced that it would impose additional tariffs on a range of US imports from June 1, and \"would fight to the end\".Established in 1925 and now having more than 200 employees, Haenchen makes its products solely in Germany.So far, the company has not been directly affected by the US-China trade tensions, but Haenchen said he is concerned.He fretted that as some potential Chinese buyers of Haenchen's cylinders may have to buy valves in the United States' market to go with the cylinders, the trade row would lead to higher prices of the valves and force the potential Chinese buyers to change their orders or even abandon Haenchen's cylinders altogether.\"For us, this means that we cannot sell the cylinder, even though we are not directly involved in the higher customs duties,\" he said.In addition, Haenchen said his company has established business relations with companies in the automobile industry, where he found the situation has become more uncertain.German carmakers BMW Group and Audi AG, both of which said that it is free trade that made their success, are calling for free and fair trade relations.\"We are not interested in further escalating the trade conflict between the US and China,\" said a BMW spokesperson.A spokesman of Volkswagen said lately that the trade frictions between China and the US have yet to exert a direct impact on its supply chain, but they do affect industry climate for consumers.The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, also warned in a recent report that uncertainties brought by trade frictions between China and the US could have an adverse impact on the global economy.It noted that the uncertainties and the impact on global supply chains caused by the trade frictions are being gradually unleashed, ranging from postponed enterprise investment decisions to easing external demand for some countries due to disrupted supply chains.What concerns Haenchen most is the planning uncertainty generated by the US-China tariff conflict. \"The planning uncertainty is always bad for the economy,\" he said.His family-owned company, now managed by the third generation, has businesses both in China and the US, with a sales volume of 22 million euros (around $24.57 million) in 2018 worldwide.Independent family-owned business companies like Haenchen's make up about 99.5 percent of total enterprises in Germany, according to data from Germany Trade and Invest, an economic development agency.If the US-China trade conflict continues or worsens, Haenchen said the uncertainty will not only affect his company but the entire German economy.XinhuaCopyright 1995 -.

Common interests unite us, and we care about taking care of that relationship, as if it were with close friends,\" said Felipe Villalobos, a social media manager with Xiaomi Chile.The connection with \"Mi Fans\" is part of the company's strategy of \"being by and for\" its supporters to search for friends over clients, as the fans \"will search for our products and create a need on the market tomorrow,\" Villalobos explained.Santiago's \"Mi Store\" opened in late April under the close watch of 1,500 followers, who thanked the brand for listening to users' advice and \"making them participate in their products\", Gustavo Belmar, a customer and surgeon, told Xinhua.The \"Mi Fans\" demand quality from Chinese products. They value lower prices and recognize the company's consideration toward its customers.Xiaomi now has 130 products available in Chile, including cellphones, security cameras, computers, robot vacuums, bicycles, electric scooters, and accessories.The company is looking to open another six stores and consolidate its expansion in Chile and the region after its landing in Mexico, and to introduce technologies as yet unknown to Latin America, according to Xiaomi.Sergio de la Fuente, a Mi fan, said the launch of the store in Chile was \"like a dream\".\"I was very happy to see that Xiaomi had preserved its philosophy of delivering the best technology at a very good price. I really look forward to the arrival of other stores and many more things,\" the fan said.The Latin American market is crucial and attractive for the brand - especially Chile, \"a country that tends to adopt new technologies very rapidly\", a brand communication said.Currently, there is high demand in the South American country for these types of devices, and thus a greater offer is in need from technology companies, which boosts competition and benefits consumers, the Chinese firm said.The company highlighted the possibility of contributing to an \"easy, healthy, and safe\" life through the internet of things.The ties between China and Chile have allowed Xiaomi and other Chinese companies to come to the South American country.In 2005, Chile became the first Latin American country to sign a free-trade agreement with China, and in 2019, it became the first country in the region to update the agreement with China.\"It's an extremely positive factor that allows us to develop a solid and growing business for the national market, with best technology and quality for Chilean consumers,\" Xiaomi said in a statement.Founded in 2010, Xiaomi Corporation is the world's fourth-largest smartphone brand and has established the biggest internet platform for consumer goods.

Zhang Zhihao and Zhang Yangfei report.Editor's note: This is the first in a series of stories reflecting China's achievements in fields such as science, law enforcement, education and transportation resulting from 40 years of the reform and opening-up policy. Other stories will follow in coming weeks.Saving millions from malaria with an ancient remedyTu Youyou's resume may pale in comparison with those of other Nobel laureates, because she only holds a bachelor's degree, has no overseas research experience and is not a fellow of any Chinese scientific academies.However, her discovery of artemisinin, the active compound that serves as the backbone for the most effective antimalarial treatment to date, has helped avert more than 6.2 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2015, according to the World Health Organization. By the end of 2016, artemisinin and its partner drugs were being used by 80 countries and regions.In 2015, Tu won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, becoming the first Chinese to win the award. In January last year, she became one of two recipients of the 2016 State Preeminent Science and Technology Award, China's highest scientific honor.The 87-year-old from Ningbo, Zhejiang province, is now working on understanding and overcoming resistant to artemisinin in plasmodium (mosquito parasites that cause malaria). Her team is also investigating the use of the drug to cure illnesses such as cancer, lupus (an autoimmune disease) and leukemia.\"My greatest wish is that as our country reforms and opens up, our institutes will allow more capable young scientists to stand out and contribute to its development,\" she said in a 2015 speech.In 1967, malaria was ravaging the population of southern China, so the government formed Mission 523, a project to discover a cure for the illness.As an expert in traditional Chinese medicine, Tu was appointed head of the mission in 1969, but her quest was daunting because more than 240,000 compounds had already been tested unsuccessfully across the world.Tu decided to start from scratch by scouring medical literature from ancient China along with folk treatments, and consulting TCM practitioners.After a few months she discovered that sweet wormwood had been used as malaria treatment in China since 400 AD. However, crude extracts of the plant could not reliably inhibit plasmodium growth, which meant the active ingredient had to be identified.Over the next two years, Tu and her colleagues made 190 consecutive, but fruitless, attempts to raise the inhibition rate to 100 percent. By the time the right active ingredient, artemisinin, had been found and extracted, Tu was seriously ill with toxic hepatitis due to long exposure to poisonous solvents.The drug showed promise during tests on mice and monkeys, but some researchers were concerned about its toxicity in humans. In response, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient, saying, \"I am the head of the research team - it is my responsibility.\"In 1978, the appraisal committee for Mission 523 approved the use of artemisinin-based drugs to treat malaria. From the early 2000s, the World Health Organization gradually adopted the use of artemisinin-based combination drug therapies as first-line treatment for tackling malaria worldwide.Copyright 1995 -.

If the service providers cannot offer high-quality and carefree services, customers will stay away.\"Despite current setbacks, the sharing model still has potential if well managed.A JD Power survey shows that 70 percent of its respondents said they are sure or likely to give up their own cars if mobility services including car-sharing and ride-hailing meet their expectations.Copyright 1995 -.

I was so excited to find this business model that is mature in foreign markets but still untapped in our region,\" she adds.Zhou says, China has become the world's largest producer and consumer of automobiles - the country produced more than 24 million passenger cars in 2017 according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. She pointed to the 10 consecutive years of growth and the fact that the 1,000th race of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship being held in Shanghai this year as proof that the industry is booming and evolving.Despite the nation's automotive industry lagging behind the rest of the world for nearly 70 years, Zhou believes that the nation is on the cusp of a great era in Chinese automotive culture. SSC will play its part by taking visitors on a journey through the history of the automobile industry and how it has helped shape the evolution of social development and human civilization.James Goldcrown, one of the world's hottest graffiti and fashion artists, who designed the \"go viral love\" wall, will showcase some of his designs at the exhibition.The works of French sculptor Zoe Vayssieres, mosaic glass artist Chen Weide, post-impressionist contemporary oil painter Li Zili, and photographer Wang Gangfeng will also be on show, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in more conventional forms of art, alongside the (mostly) four-wheeled masterpieces made from metal, rubber and carbon fiber.Another noteworthy highlight is a complete private collection of 248 Supreme skateboards, dating from 1998 to 2018 and is the only set of its kind in the world.

Based on the new information, all IEEE members, regardless of employer, may continue to participate in all activities of the organization, it said.On May 16, the US Department of Commerce put Huawei on its Entity List, which prohibits US makers of technological products from selling their wares to Huawei.On Wednesday, the IEEE announced a ban on employees of Huawei and its 68 affiliates from publication peer review and some editorial processes. It said on Monday that the ban was \"motivated solely by the desire to protect volunteers and members from legal risk\" and that the risk has been addressed by the clarification from the US government.The ban had sparked an outcry among academics.Ten Chinese academic institutions, including the China Institute of Communications, Chinese Institute of Electronics and Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, expressed their opposition in a joint statement on Sunday night, calling the ban \"unbelievable\" and saying they were \"deeply shocked\".\"The participation of scientists in journal reviews is the basic right to perform their peer review responsibilities and should not be subject to discrimination by nationality, ethnicity or institutions,\" the joint statement said.\"The restriction on normal academic exchanges violates the spirit of academic independence and the values of the scientific community, and it brutally damages the order of academic exchange and technological development,\" it said, adding that scientists should be highly-alert to the politicization of science.The 10 associations, as well as many Chinese scientists and experts in the industry, have reiterated that science should have no national boundaries.The associations said that the IEEE, as a nonpolitical and nonprofit organization with an international influence, should not be connecting members to political agendas. Rather members should be independent, they said.The ban deviated from the core scientific value of \"trust\" and was a serious act of discrimination against scientists and institutions. It was a step backward in the development of academic exchanges, they said.\"As academic organizations with good long-term cooperation with the IEEE, we firmly oppose the politicization of academic exchanges, any attempt to challenge free and equal academic standards and any act that undermines the fair and just academic environment,\" they said.In the statement, they also called on scientists, scientific organizations and academic communities around the world to pay attention to the major crisis, jointly defend international standards of academic exchanges and ensure that scientific research is not politicized.After learning of the ban, Zhang Haixia, a professor at Peking University and a 20-year member of the IEEE, submitted an open letter on Friday resigning from the organization and stepping down from the editorial board.On Monday morning, Zhang said she received a letter from the president of the IEEE, Jose M.F. Moura, notifying her that the ban had been lifted. \"This is the best news I've heard after sending my open letter,\" she said.She said in a follow-up open letter replying to Moura that she will rejoin the IEEE editorial board. \"It is a good thing for the IEEE to lift the restrictions. It is thanks to the firm statements made by many Chinese associations that the IEEE made such a quick response,\" she said.\"Academics should be independent and separated from politics. This is the bottom line of academic research and cannot be violated,\" she said.Zou Shuo contributed to this story.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

After a 2.5 billion euro dividend paid to existing FCA shareholders, investors in each company would receive half of the new entity.This would be chaired by John Elkann, head of the Agnelli family that controls 29 percent of FCA, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters, while Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard would likely become CEO.Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the proposed merger could be good news for Italy if it helped Fiat to grow, but it was crucial to preserve jobs.He did not comment on the French government's 15 percent stake in Renault, but an influential lawmaker from the ruling League party said Rome may seek a stake in the combined group to balance France's holding.A deal could help both companies address shortcomings, as well as the challenges of switching to electric and self-driving technologies and tougher emissions regulations.FCA has a highly profitable businesses in North America with its RAM trucks and Jeep brand, but lost money last quarter in Europe, where most of its plants are running below 50% capacity and it may struggle with new emissions curbs.Renault, by contrast, was an early mover in electric cars, with relatively fuel-efficient engine technologies and a strong presence in emerging markets, but no US business.\"The case for combination is also strengthened by the need to take bold decisions to capture at scale the opportunities created by the transformation of the auto industry,\" FCA said.It could also have profound repercussions for Renault's 20-year-old alliance with Nissan, already weakened by the crisis surrounding the arrest and ousting of former chairman Carlos Ghosn late last year.Milan-listed FCA shares jumped as much as 19 percent in early trade, while Renault stock leapt 17 percent. PSA shares fell 2.5 percent.\"FCA fits as well with Renault as it does with PSA,\" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said in a note.FCA-Renault, like almost every possible automotive pairing, had been studied intermittently for years by dealmakers.But the fractious relations between Ghosn and FCA's late CEO Sergio Marchionne made constructive merger talks impossible until after Marchionne's sudden death last July, banking sources said.Before his November arrest in Japan, Ghosn had revived discussions about a deal to bring FCA into a reinforced Renault-Nissan alliance, sources have told Reuters.The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, supports a merger with FCA in principle but will need to see more details, its main spokeswoman said on Monday.France will be \"particularly vigilant regarding employment and industrial footprint,\" another Paris official said, adding that any deal must safeguard Renault's alliance with Nissan, which had recently rebuffed a merger proposal from the French carmaker.Seeking to soothe concerns, FCA stressed \"new opportunities for employees of both companies\".\"The benefits of the proposed transaction are not predicated on plant closures, but would be achieved through more capital-efficient investment in common global vehicle platforms, architectures, powertrains and technologies,\" it said.Nissan, which is 43.4-percent-owned by Renault, would be invited to nominate a director to the 11-member board of the new company.As alliance partners, Nissan and its affiliate Mitsubishi would benefit from an estimated 1 billion euros in annual savings from the merger, FCA added.ReutersCopyright 1995 -.

The internal components of today's chips are measured in nanometers, or one-billionth of a meter, and making them requires deep knowledge in math, physics and chemistry.\"Manufacturing high-end electronics has always been a challenge for China,\" Wu said. \"Japan and South Korea are world leaders in chipmaking because they have poured in staggering amounts of investment and have received extensive support from the United States for decades.\"While China has better self-sufficiency in military and government computer systems, it still lacks the advanced equipment and engineering know-how to reliably make high-end, cost-efficient commercial chips, he said.In recent years, China has improved its chipmaking capability by allocating investment, as well as creating favorable policies for businesses and attracting high-quality talent from overseas, said Liu Lifeng, a professor at Peking University's School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science.Last year, China's leading chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup signed a 150 billion yuan ($23.8 billion) deal with China Development Bank and the country's national integrated circuit fund. The Finance Ministry said last month that it has introduced tax breaks for up to five years for Chinese chipmakers.China may invest hundreds of billions of yuan in the near future to boost its semiconductor sectors, but the scale is still relatively small compared to industry giants such as Intel, which spends more than $10 billion annually on research and development, Liu said.Copyright 1995 -.

Now 194 million people live in rented accommodation, accounting for 13.9 percent of the population. By 2025, the market volume will grow to 3 trillion yuan with the number of tenants reaching 252 million.\"The long-term rental market will usher in new development in 2018 as the country will continue to support it by issuing favorable policies,\" said a report on the Chinese rental market in February, released by the China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent property research organizations. \"It will also help the relative companies to grow and push the market forward.\"On Monday, Kunming Sinobright Group Co, parent company of 5i5j Group signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Haier, the country's leading home appliances manufacturer, marking the latest move in the country's heated long-term rental market.The two sides plan to work together on the sales and rentals of smart home appliances and financial services related to long-term rentals. They also aim to develop an operation system to combine the smart home appliances within apartments.Such cooperation aims to improve the experiences of tenants in the era of the internet of things.5i5j's business covers 15 major cities in China including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and Nanjing, Jiangsu province, with more than 3,300 branches.Xiangyu, the property asset management service provider owned by 5i5j, administers more than 530,000 rooms in over 14 cities in China, with tenants exceeding 5 million.Copyright 1995 -.

New impetus in e-commerce consumption won't emerge unless the participants in e-commerce can break the bottleneck of the sluggish browsing volume,\" Nie said.E-commerce in 2016 indeed indicated some new phenomena, however, according to Nie.First, it facilitates supply-side structural reform. By precise calculation through real-time monitoring and big data analysis, information about demand can guide the volume of supply, for more efficient, personalized service.As the digital economy shows rapid growth amid implementation of the Internet Plus strategy all over the country, e-commerce has become a significant part of it.Second, the traditional retail industry is transforming. From the circulation channels and supply chains, to data collection and trading, the online and offline aspects are gradually opening up for each other, pointing to a convergence of their further development. In 2016, with social network e-commerce featuring web celebrities, WeChat business reached a new level.Online retailers and social networking platforms have been integrated with pictures, video and live broadcasting.In recent years, new formats and patterns of online retail are emerging. B2B experienced strong development. Increasingly efficient information exchanges between the demand and supply sides conducted through e-commerce platforms solved the issues of excess capacity, high circulation cost and invalid supply.Finally, cross-border e-commerce has continued to thrive under new governmental regulations.It plays a positive role in stabilizing foreign trade and promoting innovation.\"Online shopping's quality and customer experience should be improved by removal of technical limitations. Through technological innovation, e-commence can embrace new opportunities brought about by the upgrading of consumption,\" Nie said.At present, the development of e-commerce has entered a new phase. The advantage of e-commerce, compared with traditional retail, is its digitized operation, as it can better process and analyze customers' appetites, said Xu Danxia, head of XBN, a crossborder e-commerce platform.Pactera Technology International, a leading software service provider in China, has upgraded its technology to ensure greater convenience for its e-commence clients.It provides solutions for e-commerce platforms in the fields of product display, search, order processing, logistics and payment methods through new online applications.It helps to realize value-added services of online shopping platforms based on digital calculations.\"In the past six years, China's e-commerce has undergone extraordinary development. We have together witnessed China becoming the largest and fastest-growing e-commerce market in the world,\" said Wang Bingnan, assistant minister of the Ministry of Commerce.At present, e-commerce is one of the most vigorous fields of China's economy, and the rapid development of various new formats and modes is an important highlight in China's economic development, said Wang.The 2016 China E-commerce Report was compiled by the Ministry of Commerce who organized experts and industrial insiders to perform deep research on the industry.The report was released at the 2017 China E-commerce Conference during the 2017 CIFTIS.Copyright 1995 -.

Its mission is to facilitate exchanges and cooperation in politics, economy, culture, business and trade between China and Africa.\"Most Chinese companies want to step out of China, but what they are concerned about is the security of foreign countries and investment risks,\" Cheng said.The China Africa Industrial Forum has set up a legal affairs department and gathered experts to provide enterprises with advice on avoiding risks.In addition, if Chinese enterprises encounter problems in the process of investing in Africa, the forum will help resolve the case.According to Cheng, the 2017 CIFTIS will show more than 1,000 projects in the Africa-themed exhibition.Those projects will cover the industries of manufacturing, new energy, logistics, healthcare, finance and tourism.Some of the projects will highlight agricultural industries. Due to adverse climates and technical shortages, agriculture in some African countries is struggling. The forum hopes China can provide those areas with knowledge and advanced agricultural technology.The China Africa Industrial Forum has also invited ambassadors of these countries to illustrate the development and investment environment of their countries at the fair.The forum will provide Chinese entrepreneurs with opportunities to have face-to-face exchanges with African experts and leaders, and advocates orderly development of competition for Chinese companies.More detailed information will be announced at the fair to provide more choices for Chinese investors.In recent years, trade volume between China and Africa has been sluggish. Since 2015, the trade volume has continuously dropped, Cheng said.\"But in 2017, I believe that Chinese-African trade will catch up with the volume seen in 2014. I hope that Chinese investors will have a specific target,\" Cheng said.Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

Up to now, it has invested in 24 fintech companies, covering the areas of lending, payment, personal finance, wealth management, enterprise solutions and insurance.By the third quarter of 2017, a total of 13 firms, invested by CreditEase, ranked among the \"Fintech 250\" list released by US-based venture capital database CB Insights, and the figure has been rising ever since.CreditEase attributes its success so far to its international team of veteran financial professionals who work across different time zones every day.Usually around 8 am in Beijing, its multinational team starts its work day with focus on communication. \"Geographical separation and time differences won't be a barrier, and every member within the team, no matter where he is, is able to communicate with each other every day,\" said Cong Yu, a managing partner of the fund.\"We make decisions in a short period of time. It takes us two to four weeks from getting to know a case, to doing relevant research, and finally deciding whether to invest in the case or not,\" said Cong.\"A global footprint is the company's goal. The company's two major businesses are inclusive finance and wealth management, and all of our businesses under wealth management are involved in overseas markets,\" said Tang Ning, founder and chief executive officer of CreditEase.Its overseas businesses include immigration, house purchases, education, tax planning, internship recommendation, legal service referral, insurance, short-term study, family trusts.\"We have been working on consumers' overseas life service for several years, and the overseas investment sector is also the company's target,\" said Tang.In April 2017, CreditEase was recognized as a registered investment advisor by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, marking its foray into the US' wealth management market.It has expanded its overseas business across numerous countries and regions, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Israel, Portugal and Germany.\"We value the expertise CreditEase owns in fintech innovation. Many new technologies, such as cross-border payment, and block chain, are still at infancy stage. I am sure there is huge market potential lying in the sector,\" said Xiong Xiaoge, global chairman of IDG whose venture capital arm IDG Capital formed a comprehensive strategic partnership with CreditEase in 2017.\"Besides, the company possesses numerous talents in the field, which is another reason why we choose to team up with CreditEase,\" Xiong said.Apart from IDG Capital, CreditEase has joined hands with various international partners, such as Wellington Financial Limited, Credit Agricole, Tishman Speyer and Blackstone Group.On March 21, CreditEase signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Amundi Asset Management, the largest asset manager by assets in Europe, in Beijing. This deal made CreditEase the first cooperative partner of Amundi in China in the asset management industry.Chen Zhichao, chief investment officer at Tishman Speyer China, said, \"CreditEase has left us with the impression of 'strictness'. For all the overseas cases we partnered with CreditEase, the company conducted highly responsible due diligence from the very beginning.\"The company doesn't blindly trust so-called experts. Instead, it makes its own judgments from both commercial and market perspectives, which offers deep insights with a global vision.\"Apart from assisting overseas companies, CreditEase offers help to Chinese investors to manage their wealth in overseas markets. Good Hope Investment Services Ltd, a sub brand under Creditease Wealth Management, works closely with Chinese high net-worth migrants to develop personalized wealth management, investment, tax planning, insurance, immigration and lifestyle solutions.The company offers clients institutional advice on a range of issues, provided by a talented team of international professionals with local expertise. Now, the sub brand manages over $1 billion US and European investment assets.\"As global asset allocation has been booming in recent years, many of our customers immigrate through investment. Our concept is to endow immigration with more financial investment attributes. Apart from letting consumers get an identity, I wish to use my investment experience to help them gain more returns on investment,\" said Jenny Zhan, general manager of Good Hope.Song Li, 54, a Chinese client of Good Hope whose son, aged 23, studies for MBA medical engineering accountancy in Miami, Florida, considered an immigration-oriented investment programs two years ago. \"On accepting the case, the consultant team handed in the application within a month, and 10 months later, our whole family were granted the initial approval issued by the USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services). We are confident that Good Hope would bring satisfying investment benefits to us,\" said Song.With the market booming, not only consumers but foreign partners of CreditEase are confident about the company's business overseas. \"China's wealth management industry is at a turning point. Asset allocation will also undergo structural changes. With the market opening up further, there will be more new investment opportunities and more possibilities of asset management,\" said Richard Williamson, managing director of the offshore business for CreditEase Wealth Management.He said China's wealth management market is becoming complete as well as individual-oriented. \"The global market potential for consultants and extended services is huge,\" said Williamson.Copyright 1995 -.

China is one of the members of this committee.Yuan visited Ta Keo to inspect the restoration work, which the academy started in 2010.\"Maybe it's our best way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ICC-Angkor and the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia,\" she said.Construction of Ta Keo as a \"state temple\" began during the reign of Jayavarman V, a ruler during the Khmer Empire (802-1431). Covering 46,000 square meters, the site is generally considered one of the most magnificent temple-mountains in Angkor.The term temple-mountain refers to the style for the construction of state temples during the Khmer Empire, which was influenced by Indian temple architecture.\"It's important evidence showing the transition of architectural styles from the early-stage Angkor sites with typical Hindu characters from India to the later ones featuring local Buddhism,\" Yuan said.Ta Keo is also believed to be the first temple built entirely from sandstone in the Khmer Empire.However, when the academy started restoration work, experts had to sift through tens of thousands of fallen stones and largely collapsed halls, corridors and turrets.\"We had to find the right stones in the rubble and put them back,\" Yuan said. \"Everything has to be concise. But restoration is far more than putting the fallen stones back. The bulk of the work is done through detailed research before the engineers start.\"Copyright 1995 -. All rights reserved.

Chinese singer-songwriter and author Liu Jian and his American journalist wife, Rebecca Kanthor, created Hand in Hand for their children and all kids in China to hear the best live music for families from around the world and learn about different cultures through music.The idea was to offer music-loving parents like themselves more child-friendly music events.\"We used to go to music festivals and live music shows all the time. But after we had kids, we didn't go as much, because it was too hard to take our kids where they weren't comfortable,\" Liu said.Having decided to improve the situation, Liu saw the answer in a children's music CD from US. \"It was so good, I was inspired to bring them to China to tour. Then we realized that there are so many great bands for kids all over the world and the idea for the festival was born,\" he said.The couple launched Hand in Hand in 2017 and joined hands with Emmy-winning Lucky Diaz and the Family Jam Band from the US, as well as acclaimed rock band Hippe Gasten from Holland.So far the musicians have traveled to Shenzhen, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nantong, Guangzhou, Shijiazhuang, Beijing and performed for over 20,000 people.

In the video, Ma pays tribute to the rappers of different generations from Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.As he raps in Mandarin, Xinjiang rappers appear with slow-motion clips that highlight the sights of Xinjiang, from built-up cities to sprawling deserts and soaring snowcapped mountains.\"If you want to understand the song you need to watch the video,\" says Ma, who spent six months traveling throughout Xinjiang early this year as he made the video. Within 48 hours of its release on Ma's Sina Weibo account it had been viewed more than one million times.\"This is more than just a new song for me,\" Ma says. \"It also shows how vibrant Xinjiang's hip-hop scene is. Some of the rappers in the video are no longer active but they were the ones who laid the foundations for the growth of hip-hop in the region. This song is dedicated to them and the future of Xinjiang hip-hop music.\"Wearing a loose red long-sleeved T-shirt, black shorts and headband, Ma, who lives in Karamay, 300 kilometers northwest of Urumqi, sits in a meeting room in a Beijing office building. For the previous few months he has been shuttling between Karamay and Beijing as he has taken part in the second season of the internet reality show The Rap of China, which premiered through the streaming media platform iQiyi in summer last year.Since the first season of The Rap of China, rappers from Xinjiang have come to the attention of huge audiences. Ma was one of them.The songs he performed in the show, including Max, which refers to his stage name and is a song of self-introduction, and Dong Cheng Xi Jiu (East Meets West), in which he portrays the dynamism of Xinjiang culture, are cleverly crafted amalgams of his Xinjiang heritage and hip-hop music.At times relying on traditional Xinjiang musical instruments such as the rawap and the dutar, Ma vividly evokes the life, lives and character of the region. These include pomegranate juice sold at the International Bazaar in Urumqi, Gulnazar and Dilraba, two popular young Chinese actresses from Xinjiang, and the unique cultural role the region plays, sitting along the ancient Silk Road as China's northwestern doorway to Central and West Asia.Copyright 1995 -.

Cheung is one of Hong Kong's biggest pop stars and has been on his world tour since 2016.After 191 shows around the globe, he will finally close The Classic Tour, with 15 shows at the Hong Kong Coliseum from Jan 11 to 29, 2019.As he toasted the crew members who have joined him on his globe-trotting adventure over the past two years, including art director Yee Chung-man and music director Goh Kheng Long, Cheung was full of enthusiasm, while choking back tears of emotion.\"I often got stressed during the tour because lots of things tended to happen. Every week, we would repeat the same procedure and do the same things together,\" he says. \"However, I was always refreshed when I went out on the stage. I practiced my singing at home before the tour began, but it never feels the same as when I sing in front of 10,000 fans.\"The singer has made headlines while performing his sold-out shows, but not, as you would expect, for his stellar performances. More than 20 people wanted by police have been arrested at his concerts in the last six months, including a dozen people who were apprehended at his show in Xianyang, Shaanxi province, on Sept 30.While fans give credit to Cheung's wide popularity, which appeals to people of different ages and all walks of life, the singer says that police relied mainly on facial recognition software to catch the criminals and that \"they would be caught by police anyway, and that could happen anywhere, like in a supermarket or at a concert.\"He said: \"We just need to do the right thing.\"It's not the first time that Cheung has embarked on a long and grueling tour schedule. Back in 1995, he had held his record-breaking 100-show world tour. Then, in 2010, Cheung started the Jacky Cheung 1/2 Century World Tour, which has a Guinness World Records' entry for \"the largest combined audience of a live act in a year\". Between December 2010 and December 2011, Cheung entertained more than 2 million people at more than 140 shows across 61 cities in China, the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.\"I prepared myself well for the long tour and what made The Classic Tour special is that I made so many plans for it, such as the song list, the dancing, the costumes and the stage set,\" he explained.Copyright 1995 -.

Now, the country is the world's largest source of international scholars. Zou Shuo reports.This is the sixth in a series of stories reflecting China's achievements in a range of fields, including science, law enforcement, education and transportation, resulting from 40 years of the reform and opening-up policy. More stories will follow.In 1978, when China adopted the reform and opening-up policy, only 860 people traveled overseas to study. Most of them were sponsored by the government, and many were mistaken for Japanese nationals by their peers at universities in the West.In 1981, the Test of English as a Foreign Language was held in China for the first time, and 615 candidates took the exam in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Guangdong province.In 1984, China started to allow self-financing students to study overseas. Most had to find part-time work to pay their tuition fees.In 1993, Beijing New Oriental School was established by Yu Minhong. The school offered intensive training for students planning to go abroad via TOEFL and Graduate Record Examinations.Many English training institutions were established at the turn of the century in response to a significant rise in the number of students hoping to study overseas.Last year, 608,400 Chinese studied overseas. The figure topped the 600,000 mark for the first time, accounting for a year-on year rise of 11.74 percent and cementing China's position as the world's largest source of international students.Meanwhile, although developed countries and regions such as the United States and Western Europe remain the most popular destinations, countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative have started to attract large numbers of students from China.Last year, 66,100 students, including 3,679 on government sponsorships, studied in 37 BRI countries.In total, nearly 5.2 million Chinese have studied overseas in the past 40 years. This year, 1,454,100 Chinese students are attending higher education institutions overseas.Statistics show that between 1978 and 2017 the number of students returning from overseas, especially high-caliber graduates, grew steadily.At the last count, 3,132,000 - 83 percent - of those who pursued studies abroad had returned to China after graduation.These returnees are increasingly equipped with the skills required to support industrial development and government strategies for growth, as such they have become an important pillar of the national labor force.Copyright 1995 -.
